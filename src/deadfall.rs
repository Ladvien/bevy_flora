//! Pooled deadfall: the stumps, fallen trees and bucked logs of a forest floor, drawn from a
//! [`TreePool`] as its trees are, so thousands of them cost a handful of draws.
//!
//! [`build_pool_with_deadfall`](crate::build_pool_with_deadfall) cuts every variant once, as [`FellTree`](crate::FellTree) would
//! (the stump and its cut face, the wood above the cut at each level of detail and its face, the
//! contact points a fallen tree rests on, the cut's outline for the hinge, and the logs
//! [`BuckTree`] would make), and a [`PooledDeadfall`] places one: a stump stands
//! where it was put, a lying tree is turned about the hinge of its cut until its limbs reach the
//! ground there ([`FloraGround`] included), and bucked logs lie in a row from the stump.
//!
//! Deadfall is static and never indexed ([`FloraIndex`](crate::FloraIndex)), shakes nothing and
//! sheds nothing; it is fire fuel, and takes [`NotShadowCaster`] like a pooled tree does. Insert
//! [`BuckTree`] on a lying one and it becomes bucked in place.
