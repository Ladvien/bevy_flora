//! Growing trees in the vertex shader.
//!
//! A tree with [`GpuGrowth`] is built once, at maturity, and uploaded once.
//! Every vertex carries which node it belongs to and where it sits relative to
//! that node's axis; each frame the CPU ages the skeleton ([`Skeleton::aged`])
//! and writes one small record per node into a storage buffer, and the vertex
//! shader (`growth.wesl`) moves every vertex to where the CPU path would have
//! put it. Nothing else is uploaded.

/// frame. Add it to an entity that has [`ProceduralTree`](crate::ProceduralTree)
/// and [`TreeAge`](crate::TreeAge) (and, to make the tree grow,
/// [`Growing`](crate::Growing)).
///
/// The mature tree is built once per change of [`ProceduralTree`](crate::ProceduralTree)
/// and uploaded once; each frame only a few kilobytes of per-node state are
/// written. A tree on this path costs the CPU microseconds per frame instead of
/// the 0.1-0.5 ms the CPU path takes, which makes growing a forest affordable.
///
/// Without this component a tree behaves exactly as before.
///
/// # What differs from the CPU path
///
/// The tree is the same at every age in its overall shape, but it is a
/// deformation of the mature mesh, not a rebuild:
///
/// - **Smoothing** ([`MeshParams::smooth_iterations`](crate::MeshParams::smooth_iterations))
///   is computed once, on the mature mesh, and deformed with the tree; the CPU
///   path smooths every age afresh.
/// - **Ring and side counts are the mature ones.** With
///   [`MeshParams::adaptive_resolution`](crate::MeshParams::adaptive_resolution)
///   a young thin branch keeps the sides of the mature branch.
/// - **Unborn parts have zero size**, instead of being absent; their triangles
///   collapse to a point and draw nothing.
/// - With [`FoliagePlacement::AllBranches`](crate::FoliagePlacement::AllBranches),
///   leaves keep their mature positions along a branch and the first ones appear
///   as it lengthens; the CPU path respaces them.
/// - Tip-cluster leaves that are mirrored away from the trunk
///   ([`FoliagePlacement::TipClusters`](crate::FoliagePlacement::TipClusters))
///   keep the mirroring the mature tree chose.
/// - Leaf normals and the shape of primary bases follow the mature tree.
/// - A growing pointed trunk ends in a flat cap; with smoothing on, the CPU
///   path softens that cap into a point while the tree is young.
/// - The [`Mesh`](bevy::mesh::Mesh) assets on the tree's children, and the
///   bounding box derived from them, are the **mature** tree at every age:
///   picking, physics and frustum culling see the grown size, not the current one.
/// - Growth does not feed motion vectors (temporal anti-aliasing sees a growing
///   branch as still).
///
