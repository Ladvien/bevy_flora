//! Forests: many trees drawn from a few built ones.
//!
//! A [`TreePool`] is a handful of variants of one tree (the same parameters with
//! different seeds), each built once at three levels of detail
//! ([`build_lods`]) with its meshes and materials shared. A [`PooledTree`] is a
//! tree placed from a pool: it carries nothing but which variant it is, and
//! [`FloraPlugin`](crate::FloraPlugin) gives it a child entity per level of
//! detail and, far away, an impostor ([`crate::impostor`]). Entities that share
//! a mesh and a material are drawn in one instanced call by Bevy, so a few
//! thousand draw calls cover a hundred thousand trees; which child is drawn is
//! decided by the distance to the camera (a [`VisibilityRange`] on each, with a
//! short dithered cross-fade).
//!
//! Pooled trees are static: they have the age the pool was built at. Trees that
//! grow stay [`ProceduralTree`] (with
//! [`GpuGrowth`](crate::GpuGrowth)), which suits the few that are close.
