//! Baking the pictures of an impostor.
//!
//! For every [`TreePool`] variant without an [`ImpostorAtlas`], a scene is
//! spawned on two render layers of its own, far from the origin: eight copies of
//! the variant's level 1 tree, each turned a further eighth of a turn, twice (once
//! for the colour picture and once for the surface picture), and sixteen
//! orthographic cameras, each looking at its copy and drawing into its own tile of
//! a 2048x512 image: the top row of tiles holds the colours, the bottom row the
//! surface (normal, crown visibility, translucency). Nothing is lit, so there is
//! no light in the scene: the scene's own lights shade the pictures when an
//! impostor is drawn (`impostor.wesl`).
//!
//! The image is read back with a [`Screenshot`]. The first frames of a new
//! scene can come out empty (shaders and meshes are still being prepared), so a
//! capture with nothing in it is thrown away and tried again a few frames later.
