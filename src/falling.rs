//! Leaves that fall from the trees: knocked off by a shake ([`TreeShakes`]), shed by a felled tree
//! as it lands ([`TreeLanded`]), let go by the season ([`FloraSeason::leaf_fall`]), or dropped on
//! demand ([`DropLeaves`]).
//!
//! A drop copies some of the tree's own leaf cards into a burst ([`LeafBurst`]): one entity with
//! one small mesh, drawn with a copy of the tree's leaf material ([`FloraExtension::falling`]),
//! whose vertex shader moves every card on the GPU. A leaf hangs where it grew until its moment
//! (the leaves of a drop let go over half a second), falls, picking up speed and tumbling, swings
//! from side to side, drifts with the [`FloraWind`], turns flat as it reaches the ground
//! ([`FloraGround`], or the height the tree stands at), lies there for about
//! [`FallingLeaves::rest`] seconds and shrinks away. Nothing moves on the CPU; the burst is
//! despawned when its last leaf is gone. The leaves look like those still on the tree (the scan,
//! the tint, the season's colour, snow) because they are drawn by the same fragment shader. A
//! shake's or a drop's leaves are copies: the tree keeps its own, and a few falling copies are not
//! missed from a crown of thousands.
//!
//! In autumn the falling leaves are the tree's own. The shaders stop drawing a deciduous tree's
//! leaf once the season's leaf fall passes the leaf's moment; as it rises, every tenth of a second
//! the leaves it has passed meanwhile let go from where they hung, each from the moment it was
//! passed, on the trees within [`FallingLeaves::autumn_distance`] of a camera (one burst per look
//! of leaves, from many trees). A leaf fall that jumps by more than 0.1 in a frame (a season set,
//! not one passing) sheds those leaves without letting them fall, and one that goes down (spring)
//! drops nothing.
//!
//! [`FallingLeaves`] sets how many fall and how long they lie. Trees drawn on the CPU
//! ([`ProceduralTree`]) and from a pool ([`PooledTree`]) drop leaves; a tree grown on the GPU
//! ([`GpuGrowth`](crate::GpuGrowth)), one drawn without [`FloraMaterial`]s and a leafless one
//! drop none, and a deciduous tree drops none of those it has shed this season.
