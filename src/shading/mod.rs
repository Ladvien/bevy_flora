//! Leaf shading and wind: the material trees are drawn with.
//!
//! [`FloraMaterial`] is a [`StandardMaterial`] with the shaders in this directory:
//!
//! - **Leaves** get an upper side that is darker and glossier than the paler, matte lower
//!   side, a midrib and side veins, a hue of their own and darker interiors of the crown (all
//!   baked into the leaf mesh by [`foliage_mesh`](crate::foliage::foliage_mesh)), and light
//!   that comes through a leaf lit from behind: the wrapped back-side `N·L` of Unreal's
//!   two-sided foliage model times a forward-scattering GGX lobe and the leaf colour, so the
//!   crown glows yellow-green toward the sun and stays dark where other leaves shade it. A
//!   leaf's gloss fades as the camera turns to face the sun: a flat card stands for a leaf or a
//!   cluster of needles, whose many surfaces would scatter the sun's glint, and reflecting all
//!   of it at once turned treetops white.
//! - **Wind** ([`FloraWind`]) bends a tree as a whole, more toward its top, and flutters each
//!   leaf (Crysis' vegetation animation, GPU Gems 3 chapter 16). A species answers it in its
//!   own way ([`WindResponse`](crate::WindResponse)), and a [`GustFront`] sweeps a band of
//!   stronger wind across the world. It runs in the vertex stage of the main pass and of the
//!   shadow maps alike, so shadows follow the motion, and costs the CPU nothing per frame:
//!   changing [`FloraWind`] writes one small shared buffer ([`FloraWindBuffer`]) and touches no
//!   material.
//!
//! The plugin uses it for every tree it draws ([`ProceduralTree`](crate::ProceduralTree),
//! [`GpuGrowth`](crate::GpuGrowth), [`TreePool`](crate::TreePool) and its impostors).
