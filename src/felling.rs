//! Felling: a cut tree falls, lands with a bounce and leaves a stump.
//!
//! Insert [`FellTree`] on a tree ([`ProceduralTree`], or a [`PooledTree`], which first becomes
//! the `ProceduralTree` of its variant). Once the tree is built, the plugin cuts its wood at
//! `cut_height`: the part below becomes a [`TreeStump`] entity, the part above falls with the
//! tree, and both get a cut face (an end-grain disc). The tree then tips over toward `direction`
//! as a rod hinged at the front of the cut would, comes to rest where its limbs first touch the
//! ground (twigs and leaves give way), and bounces a little; [`TreeLanded`] is sent the moment
//! it hits, and [`Felled`] says how far it has tipped and when it lies still. The ground is flat
//! at the height the tree stands at, unless a [`FloraGround`] resource says otherwise: then the
//! cut is measured from the uphill side of the trunk and the tree lands on the terrain, down a
//! slope or against it.
//!
//! Once it lands a felled tree stops swaying in the wind (its leaves still flutter). It is no
//! longer rebuilt when its [`ProceduralTree`] or [`TreeAge`] changes, and keeps its entity:
//! despawn it, or insert [`BuckTree`] to cut its trunk into [`TreeLog`]s lying on the ground,
//! once it has landed. Its [`TreeShape`](crate::TreeShape) turns with it but is not cut.
//!
//! Before it falls, a tree can be notched: a [`TreeNotch`] carves an axe's wedge out of its
//! trunk, deeper with each blow, and a tree felled with one is cut at the notch's floor.
