//! Bevy integration: components, the `FloraPlugin`, and the systems that
//! grow trees and rebuild their meshes.
//!
//! A tree entity carries [`ProceduralTree`] (its parameters) and [`TreeAge`].
//! Whenever either changes, [`rebuild_trees`] regenerates the meshes and keeps
//! two child entities (wood and leaves) in sync. Adding [`Growing`] advances
//! `TreeAge` every frame until the tree is mature.
//!
//! Performance: a growing tree rebuilds both meshes every frame (0.1-0.4 ms of
//! CPU per tree); `Growing` is meant for a few hero trees, not a forest. The
//! full-grown skeleton is kept between frames and regenerated only when
//! [`ProceduralTree`] changes. Trees built or rebuilt in the same frame are built
//! on all cores, and that frame waits for them; a tree with [`BuildInBackground`] is built on
//! the async compute pool instead and appears the frame its build is done. Trees with equal
//! looks (equal colours, trunk height, wind response and leaf
//! shading; seeds do not matter) share their materials, which are never
//! written in place, so the renderer prepares each look once and does not
//! re-prepare anything as a tree grows.
//!
//! For a forest, add [`GpuGrowth`] to the trees: the mature meshes are built and
//! uploaded once, and each frame only a few kilobytes of per-node state are
//! written (a few microseconds of CPU per tree); the vertex shader does the
//! growing. See its docs for what differs from the CPU path.
