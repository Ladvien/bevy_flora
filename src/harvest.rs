//! Picking a tree's fruit, and fruit a shake knocks loose.
//!
//! A fruiting tree ([`FoliageParams::fruit`](crate::FoliageParams::fruit)) drawn as a
//! [`ProceduralTree`] gets a [`TreeFruit`] once it is built: the fruit it grew, each with a key,
//! where it hangs in the tree's own space and its radius. [`TreeFruit::pick`] takes one off the
//! tree: the shaders stop drawing it (its vertices in the tree's leaf meshes are marked, on every
//! level of detail), and it stays picked as the tree grows, until the next blossom
//! ([`FloraSeason::blossom`]) brings the fruit back. The season decides which fruit hang
//! ([`TreeFruit::on_tree`]): none while the blossom is out, and the fruit drop in the first two
//! thirds of the leaf fall, as the shaders draw them.
//!
//! A shake ([`TreeShakes`]) knocks some of a tree's fruit loose ([`FallingFruit::per_shake`]):
//! each is picked from the tree and falls from where it hung as a [`FallenFruit`] entity, bounces
//! and lies on the ground ([`FloraGround`], or the height the tree stands at) for
//! [`FallingFruit::rest`] seconds, for the game to pick up (despawn) meanwhile. A [`FruitFell`]
//! message tells of each.
//!
//! Pooled trees ([`PooledTree`](crate::PooledTree)) share their meshes, so their fruit cannot be
//! picked, and a tree grown on the GPU ([`GpuGrowth`](crate::GpuGrowth)) has no `TreeFruit`
//! either: their fruit hangs as the season says.
//!
