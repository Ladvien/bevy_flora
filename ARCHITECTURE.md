# bevy_flora Architecture

Pure-Rust Bevy 0.20 crate that generates parametric, stylized trees and grows them over time.

## Pipeline

```
TreeParams
  → generate_skeleton        (skeleton.rs: Node tree, parent links, deterministic from seed;
                              gravity sets each branch's `bend`, children sit on the bent parent axis)
  → assign_birth_times       (growth.rs: birth + duration per node, from topology)
  → Skeleton::aged(age)      (drops unborn nodes; scales length/radius by progress)
  → apply_pipe_radius        (optional, mesh/branch.rs)
  → skeleton_mesh            (mesh/: trunk, collars, tubes, optional smoothing)
  → collect_leaf_points → foliage_mesh   (foliage.rs)
  → MeshData → bevy Mesh     (mesh/mod.rs)
```

`pipeline::build_tree(params, age)` runs all of it and returns `TreeMeshes`
(`trunk`, `foliage`, aged `skeleton`, `mature_at`).

## Growth model

Progress is linear. A primary is born when the trunk reaches its attachment
height; a sub-branch is born when its parent reaches `attach_t`. Radii thicken
over `duration * thickening_lag`. Leaves appear after `leaf_threshold` progress
and scale to full size. Each node draws leaf randomness from its own RNG stream
(`SeededRng::from_parts(seed, node.id)`), so aging never re-rolls existing leaves.

## Mesh conventions

Front faces are counter-clockwise; the helpers in `mesh/rings.rs` own the winding
convention. Never fix winding in an individual mesher.

A branch's shape is `Node::axis` (bent by `Node::bend`); the tube mesher, child
placement and leaf placement (`Node::point_at`) all read it, so wood, sub-branches
and leaves agree. Sub-branches spreading toward the trunk and tip-cluster leaves
landing inside it are mirrored away (`skeleton::trunk_depth`). Each primary's
tube and collar get a `root_segment` reaching into the trunk (`primary_root`),
so junctions have no open ends. Laplacian smoothing welds coincident vertices
(UV seams) and pins open boundaries and the ground ring, so it never tears or
lifts the wood; root segments are added after it, so junctions keep their shape.

## Bevy integration (plugin.rs)

- `ProceduralTree(TreeParams)` + `TreeAge(f32)` (default `INFINITY` = mature) + optional `Growing { rate }`.
- `FloraPlugin` rebuilds meshes on `Changed<ProceduralTree>` / `Changed<TreeAge>`, keeping a wood child and a leaf child. An empty trunk (age 0) leaves the wood child hidden with no mesh; the mesh is created once the trunk has geometry.
- `TreeGenerated` message reports current height/radius after each rebuild.
