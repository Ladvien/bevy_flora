# Research corpus

The reading list per domain, by home-still stem (`distill_search` / `markdown_read`), or by URL for
a web source the corpus does not hold. Each system's own note (`docs/research/<system>.md`) quotes
what it rests on; this file only says what exists. Newest additions last in each section.
