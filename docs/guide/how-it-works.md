# How it works

The pipeline from parameters to a Bevy mesh, and where the invariants live.

## How it works

`TreeParams` → skeleton (a node tree of trunk, leader, primaries, splits and sub-branches) → birth times → the skeleton at a given age → wood mesh and leaf points → `MeshData` → Bevy `Mesh`. `ARCHITECTURE.md` has the details and the invariants (winding, bend, junctions) the meshers rely on.
